# Sukoon

*Sukoon* is an emotionally intelligent language model built on the depths of human emotions, designed to bring comfort, connection, and healing.

Inspired by poetry, ghazals, qawwalis, and deeply human experiences, Sukoon aims to help people navigate emotional struggles—loneliness, grief, heartbreak, and more—by responding with warmth, empathy, and soulful understanding.

## 💡 Vision

To create an AI that feels like a friend who listens, understands, and gently holds space for our emotions. Not clinical. Not robotic. But deeply human.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (To be expanded as we build)
- Python
- NLP Libraries (spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers)
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (to be decided)
- Custom dataset built on emotionally rich text (poetry, letters, lyrics, etc.)
